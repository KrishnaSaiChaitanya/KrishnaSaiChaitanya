### [ Bookold: ](https://github.com/KrishnaSaiChaitanya/Bookold-master)<br>
Bookold is an innovative online platform for buying and selling second hand books. Rather than using actual money, users can exchange their old books for credit points, which they can then use to purchase other books on the platform. This system allows everyone to have a fair chance of obtaining the books they want, as the credit values for each book are determined using the Google Books API. In addition to the credit system, Bookold also includes a login and registration page, as well as features for placing orders and viewing past orders. If a user's book is sold, they will be notified of the buyer's location and their credit balance will be updated accordingly.

### [ Emo-Site: ]<br>
Emo-site is a dynamic website that adjusts its CSS based on user emotions detected with Face.js API.<br/> Color psychology is used to change the background colors with smooth animations.
